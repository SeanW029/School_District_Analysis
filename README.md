# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help the District School Board investigate how potential academic dishonesty relating to reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders based on a complete csv file containing detailed student information across different schools with respective scores, could affect overall district school performance analysis result. 

## Results
1. In order to perform the analysis, I replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School's 9th graders with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
2. I then repeated the school district analysis i did earlier to compare the difference between the two analyses,including total student count by subtracting the number of ninth-grade students in Thomas High School from the total student count, then recalculating the passing math and passing reading percentages, and the overall passing percentage with the recalculated total student count. From the new district and school summary DataFrame, I displayed the top and bottom 5 performing schools; the average math and reading scores for each grade level; the scores by school spending per student; the scores by school size is shown as well as the scores by school type.

## Summary
Compared to the original district school performance result, the new performance result with Thomas High School's ninth graders taken away showed very small difference in terms of overall math and reading scores. Nor did the top and bottom 5 performing schools position change. Hence it would be fair to conclude that the scope and influence of this potential academic dishonesty has little influence on the over district school performance.
