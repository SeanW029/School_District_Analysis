# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help the District School Board investigate how potential academic dishonesty relating to reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders based on a complete csv file containing detailed student information across different schools with respective scores, could affect overall district school performance analysis result. 

## Results
1. In order to perform the analysis, I replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School's 9th graders with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
2. I then repeated the school district analysis i did earlier to compare the difference between the two analyses.
